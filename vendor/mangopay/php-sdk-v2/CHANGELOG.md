## [3.6.0] - 2021-06-10
## Added

We have added a new feature **[recurring payments](https://docs.mangopay.com/guide/recurring-payments)** dedicated to clients needing to charge a card repeatedly, such as subscriptions or payments installments.

You can start testing in sandbox, to help you define your workflow. This release provides the first elements of the full feature.

- [Create a Recurring PayIn Registration object](https://docs.mangopay.com/endpoints/v2.01/payins#e1051_create-a-recurring-payin-registration), containing all the information to define the recurring payment
- [Initiate your recurring payment flow](https://docs.mangopay.com/endpoints/v2.01/payins#e1053_create-a-recurring-payin-cit) with an authenticated transaction (CIT) using the Card Recurring PayIn endpoint
- [Continue your recurring payment flow](https://docs.mangopay.com/endpoints/v2.01/payins#e1054_create-a-recurring-payin-mit) with an non-authenticated transaction (MIT) using the Card Recurring PayIn endpoint

This feature is not yet available in production and you need to contact the Support team to request access.

### Instant payment

Mangopay introduces the instant payment mode. It allows payouts (transfer from wallet to user bank account) to be processed within 25 seconds, rather than the 48 hours for a standard payout.

You can now use this new type of payout with the PHP SDK.

Example :

```php
$payOutGet = $this->_api->PayOuts->GetBankwire($payOut->Id);
// where $payOut->Id is the id of an existing payout
```

Please note that this feature must be authorized and activated by MANGOPAY. More information [here](https://docs.mangopay.com/guide/instant-payment-payout).

### Accepted PRs

- Improved documentation around ubo declaration reason
- ResponseError object improvement

## [3.4.0] - 2021-05-11
## Fixed

### IBAN for testing purposes

⚠️ **IBAN provided for testing purpose should never be used outside of a testing environement!**

## Added

### New events for PreAuthorization

Some of you use a lot the [PreAuthorization](https://docs.mangopay.com/endpoints/v2.01/preauthorizations#e183_the-preauthorization-object) feature of our API. To make your life easier, we have added three new events :

- PREAUTHORIZATION_CREATED
- PREAUTHORIZATION_SUCCEEDED
- PREAUTHORIZATION_FAILED

The goal is to help you monitor a PreAuthorization with a [webhook](https://docs.mangopay.com/endpoints/v2.01/hooks#e246_the-hook-object).

*Example: If a PreAuthorization is desynchronized, when the status is updated, you will be able to know it.*

### PSR4 / PSR12 compliance

- Thanks to @MockingMagician, the SDK is PSR4 / PSR12 compliant. That help your IDE and make sure you can run tests on case-sensitive system. Plus, docker environments has been added to run tests locally in all PHP major versions.

## Changed
- To better illustrate the fact that Rate Limiting Reset is a timestamp, we have change $rateLimits[0]->ResetTimeMillis to $rateLimits[0]->ResetTimeTimestamp

## [3.3.0] - 2021-03-25
## Added

### On demand feature for 3DSv2

> **This on-demand feature is for testing purposes only and will not be available in production**

#### Request

We've added a new parameter `Requested3DSVersion` (not mandatory) that allows you to choose between versions of 3DS protocols (managed by the parameter `SecureMode`). Two values are available:
* `V1`
* `V2_1`

If nothing is sent, the flow will be 3DS V1.

The `Requested3DSVersion` may be included on all calls to the following endpoints:
* `/preauthorizations/card/direct`
* `/payins/card/direct`

#### Response

In the API response, the `Requested3DSVersion` will show the value you requested:
* `V1`
* `V2_1`
* `null` – indicates that nothing was requested

The parameter `Applied3DSVersion` shows you the version of the 3DS protocol used. Two values are possible:
* `V1`
* `V2_1`

## Fixed

* Fixed UBO declaration by adding missing `UserId`
* Added missing `Billing` in `/payins/card/web`
* Test on `IpAddress` presence in `/payins/card/direct`
